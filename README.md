## Note
- We have used CoinGecko API for our project. CoinGecko has implemented rate limit in the API which is causing problem in retrieving data from it sometimes. 
- Also, Saved Functionality is not working in deployed environment because we are signing in user with google account. So we are attaching a video of working Functionality in local machine.
